<p>Why do we call Good Friday “good,” when it is such a dark and bleak event commemorating a day of suffering and death for Jesus?<br>
为什么我们称受难日为“良善星期五”，而这一天却是纪念耶稣受苦和死亡的黑暗日子？</p>
<hr>
<p>What is Good Friday, and why do we call the Friday of Holy Week “good”<br>
什么是受难日，我们为何称圣周的星期五为“良善”？</p>
<p>Good Friday, the Friday before Easter, is the Christian day to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus and His death at Calvary.<br>
受难日是复活节前的星期五，基督徒在这一天纪念耶稣被钉十字架和在各各他死亡。</p>
<p>This Christian holiday is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Great and Holy Friday, and Black Friday.<br>
这个基督教节日也被称为“圣星期五”、“大星期五”、“伟大而神圣的星期五”和“黑色星期五”。</p>
<p>For Christians, Good Friday is an important day of the year because it celebrates what we believe to be the most momentous weekend in the history of the world.<br>
对基督徒来说，受难日是一年中非常重要的日子，因为我们相信这标志着世界历史上最重要的周末。</p>
<p>Ever since Jesus died and was raised, Christians have proclaimed the cross and resurrection of Jesus to be the decisive turning point for all creation.<br>
自从耶稣死而复活，基督徒一直宣扬耶稣的十字架和复活是整个受造界的决定性转折点。</p>
<p>Paul considered it “of first importance” that Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and was raised to life on the third day, following what God had promised in the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:3).<br>
保罗认为最重要的是：基督照着圣经为我们的罪死了，埋葬了，第三天复活了（哥林多前书15:3）。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance; that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)<br>
「我当日所领受又传给你们的，第一，就是基督照圣经所说，为我们的罪死了；而且埋葬了；又照圣经所说，第三天复活了。」（哥林多前书15:3-4）</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Good Friday, we remember the day Jesus willingly suffered and died by crucifixion as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins (1 John 1:10).<br>
在受难日，我们纪念耶稣甘愿受苦并被钉十字架，为我们的罪做了最终的牺牲（约翰一书1:10）。</p>
<p>Easter follows it, the glorious celebration of the day Jesus was raised from the dead, heralding his victory over sin and death and pointing ahead to a future resurrection for all who are united to him by faith (Romans 6:5).<br>
紧接着的是复活节，隆重庆祝耶稣从死里复活，宣告他战胜了罪和死亡，并预示所有因信与他联合的人将来复活（罗马书6:5）。</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why is it called 'Good' Friday?</h2>
<h2>为什么叫做“Good Friday”（良善星期五）？</h2>
<p>Still, why call the day of Jesus’ death “Good Friday” instead of “Bad Friday” or something similar?<br>
然而，为什么不把耶稣受死的日子称为“坏星期五”或类似的名字，而是叫“良善星期五”？</p>
<p>Some Christian traditions take this approach: in German, for example, the day is called Karfreitag, or “Sorrowful Friday.”<br>
有些基督教传统采用了不同的叫法，比如德语称之为Karfreitag，意为“悲伤的星期五”。</p>
<p>In English, the origin of the term “Good” is debated: some believe it developed from an older name, “God’s Friday.”<br>
在英语中，“Good”的起源有争议：有人认为它源于更古老的说法——“上帝的星期五”。</p>
<p>Regardless of the origin, the name Good Friday is entirely appropriate because the suffering and death of Jesus, as terrible as it was, marked the dramatic culmination of God’s plan to save his people from their sins.<br>
无论起源如何，这一天被称为“良善”是合适的，因为耶稣的受苦和死亡虽然可怕，却是神拯救人类计划的高潮。</p>
<p>For the gospel's good news to have meaning for us, we first must understand the bad news of our condition as sinful people under condemnation.<br>
要让福音成为好消息，我们首先必须明白自己作为罪人在定罪之下的坏消息。</p>
<p>The good news of deliverance only makes sense once we see how we were enslaved.<br>
只有认识到我们曾被罪捆绑，拯救的好消息才有意义。</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that it is essential to understand and distinguish between law and gospel in Scripture.<br>
换句话说，明白并区分圣经中的律法和福音至关重要。</p>
<p>We need the law first to show us how hopeless our condition is; then, the gospel of Jesus’ grace brings us relief and salvation.<br>
我们首先需要律法显明我们的无助，然后耶稣的恩典福音带来安慰和拯救。</p>
<p>In the same way, Good Friday is “good” because as terrible as that day was, it had to happen for us to receive the joy of Easter.<br>
同样，受难日之所以“良善”，是因为那可怕的一天必须发生，我们才能得到复活节的喜乐。</p>
<p>The wrath of God against sin had to be poured out on Jesus, the perfect sacrificial substitute, for forgiveness and salvation to be poured out to the nations.<br>
神对罪的忿怒必须倾倒在耶稣——那完美的替代祭物身上，这样赦免和救恩才能临到万民。</p>
<p>Without that awful day of suffering, sorrow, and blood at the cross, God could not be both “just and the justifier” of those who trust in Jesus (Romans 3:26).<br>
没有十字架上那苦难、忧伤与血的可怕一天，神就无法既是公义的，又称信靠耶稣的人为义（罗马书3:26）。</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the day that seemed to be the greatest triumph of evil was actually the death blow in God’s gloriously good plan to redeem the world from bondage.<br>
看似恶势力最大胜利的一天，实际上却是神荣耀救赎世界计划的致命一击。</p>
<p>The cross is where we see the convergence of great suffering and God’s forgiveness.<br>
十字架是我们看到极大苦难与神赦免交汇之处。</p>
<p>Psalms 85:10 sings of a day when “righteousness and peace” will “kiss each other.”<br>
诗篇85:10预言有一天“公义和平安彼此相亲”。</p>
<p>The cross of Jesus is where that occurred, where God’s demands, his righteousness, coincided with his mercy.<br>
耶稣的十字架就是这一刻，神的要求、公义与怜悯在此相遇。</p>
<p>We receive divine forgiveness, mercy, and peace because Jesus willingly took our divine punishment, resulting from God’s righteousness against sin.<br>
因耶稣甘愿承担我们当受的神圣惩罚，我们得到了神的赦免、怜悯与平安，这是神的公义对罪的回应。</p>
<p>“For the joy set before him” (Hebrews 12:2). Jesus endured the cross on Good Friday, knowing it led to his resurrection, our salvation, and the beginning of God’s reign of righteousness and peace.<br>
“他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难”（希伯来书12:2）。耶稣在受难日忍受十字架，知道这将带来他的复活、我们的救赎，并开启神公义和平安的国度。</p>
<p>Good Friday marked the day when wrath and mercy met at the cross. That’s why Good Friday is so dark and so Good.<br>
受难日是忿怒与怜悯在十字架相遇之日，这也是为什么受难日既黑暗又良善。</p>

<h2>Good Friday in the Bible</h2>
<h2>圣经中的受难日</h2>
<p>Good Friday Prophecy: "But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:5)<br>
受难日的预言：“他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤。因他受的刑罚我们得平安，因他受的鞭伤我们得医治。”（以赛亚书53:5）</p>
<p>The events of Good Friday are recounted in all four Gospels of the New Testament.<br>
新约四福音书都记载了受难日的事件。</p>
<p>According to the Gospels, Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane after the Last Supper with His disciples. He was then put on trial before Pontius Pilate.<br>
福音书记载，耶稣与门徒吃完最后的晚餐后，在客西马尼园被捕，随后在彼拉多前受审。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people." (John 18:12-14)<br>
“兵丁和千夫长，并犹太人的差役，就拿住耶稣，把他捆绑了，先带到亚那（亚那是当年作大祭司该亚法的岳父）。这该亚法，就是从前向犹太人发议论说：‘一个人替百姓死是有益的’那位。”（约翰福音18:12-14）</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was then taken to trial before the Jewish Sanhedrin, where he was falsely accused of blasphemy. He was then sent to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, who sentenced Him to crucifixion at the demand of the chief Jewish priests.<br>
后来他被带到犹太公会受审，被诬告亵渎神，随后交给犹太巡抚彼拉多，因众祭司要求，被判钉十字架。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus replied. “I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.” (John 18:20-21)<br>
“耶稣回答说：‘我从来是明明地对世人说话；我常在会堂和殿里，就是众犹太人聚集的地方教训人，我在暗地里并没有说什么。你为什么问我呢？可以问那听见的人，我对他们说的是什么，我所说的，他们都知道。’”（约翰福音18:20-21）</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is truth?” retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, “I find no basis for a charge against him. But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?” They shouted back, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising. (John 18:38-40)<br>
“彼拉多说：‘真理是什么呢？’说了这话，又出来到犹太人那里，对他们说：‘我查不出他有什么罪来。但你们有个规矩，在逾越节，要我给你们释放一个人，你们愿意我释放犹太人的王给你们吗？’他们又喊着说：‘不要这人，要巴拉巴！’这巴拉巴是个强盗。”（约翰福音18:38-40）</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Crucifixion of Jesus:</h3>
<h3>耶稣被钉十字架</h3>
<p>As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.<br>
他们出来的时候，遇见一个古利奈人，名叫西门，就勉强他同去，好背着耶稣的十字架。</p>
<p>They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”).<br>
他们到了一个地方，名叫各各他，意思就是“髑髅地”。</p>
<p>There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.<br>
他们给耶稣喝苦胆调和的酒，他尝了就不肯喝。</p>
<p>When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.<br>
他们既将他钉十字架，就拈阄分他的衣服，然后在那里看守他。</p>
<p>Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br>
又在他头以上安一个牌子，写着他的罪状说：“这是犹太人的王耶稣。”</p>
<p>Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.<br>
当时有两个强盗和他同钉十字架，一个在右边，一个在左边。</p>
<p>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!”<br>
从那里经过的人讥诮他，摇着头说：“你这拆毁圣殿，三日又建造起来的，可以救自己吧！你如果是神的儿子，就从十字架上下来吧！”</p>
<p>In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.<br>
祭司长和文士、长老也是这样戏弄他。</p>
<p>“He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ”<br>
他们说：“他救了别人，不能救自己。他是以色列的王，现在可以从十字架上下来，我们就信他。他倚靠神，神若喜悦他，现在可以救他，因为他说‘我是神的儿子’。”</p>
<p>In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. (Matthew 27:32-44)<br>
那和他同钉的强盗也是这样的讥诮他。（马太福音27:32-44）</p>
<hr>
<h4>From the Gospel of Luke:</h4>
<h4>路加福音记载</h4>
<p>Jesus was led to Calvary, where He was crucified between two thieves.<br>
耶稣被带到髑髅地，在那里与两个犯人同钉十字架。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with Him. And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on His right and one on His left" (Luke 23:33-34)<br>
“又有两个犯人和耶稣一同带来处死。到了那名叫髑髅的地方，就在那里把耶稣钉在十字架上，又把那两个犯人也钉上，一个在右边，一个在左边。”（路加福音23:33-34）</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He hung on the cross for six hours, during which time He spoke seven last words. At about 3:00 pm, He gave up His spirit.<br>
他在十字架上悬挂了六个小时，期间讲了七句话。约在下午三点，他断了气。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, while the sun's light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, 'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!' And having said this he breathed his last." (Luke 23:44-46)<br>
“那时约有午正，遍地都黑暗了，直到申初，日头变黑了。殿里的幔子从当中裂为两半。耶稣大声喊着说：‘父啊，我将我的灵魂交在你手里！’说了这话，气就断了。”（路加福音23:44-46）</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>The Death of Jesus</h3>
<h3>耶稣的死亡</h3>
<p>From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land.<br>
从正午到下午三点，遍地都黑暗了。</p>
<p>About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lemasabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”).<br>
大约下午三点钟，耶稣大声喊着说：“以利，以利，拉马撒巴各大尼？”意思是“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”</p>
<p>When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling Elijah.”<br>
旁边站着的人听见，就说：“他呼叫以利亚呢。”</p>
<p>Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.<br>
内中有一个人赶紧跑去，拿海绵蘸满了醋，绑在苇子上送给他喝。</p>
<p>The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.” And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.<br>
其余的人说：“且等着，看以利亚来救他不来。”耶稣又大声喊叫，气就断了。</p>
<p>At that moment, the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open.<br>
那时，殿里的幔子从上到下裂为两半，地也震动，磐石也崩裂，坟墓也开了。</p>
<p>The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.<br>
已睡的圣徒的身体多有起来的。到耶稣复活以后，他们出了坟墓，进了圣城，向许多人显现。</p>
<p>When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!”<br>
百夫长和一同看守耶稣的人看见地震，并所经历的事，就极其害怕，说：“这真是神的儿子了！”</p>
<p>Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. (Matthew 27:45-56)<br>
有好些妇女在那里远远地观看，她们是从加利利跟随耶稣来服侍他的，其中有抹大拉的马利亚，还有雅各和约西的母亲马利亚，并有西庇太两个儿子的母亲。（马太福音27:45-56）</p>
<hr>
<p>Good Friday Fulfilled: "He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By His wounds you have been healed." (1 Peter 2:24)<br>
受难日的应验：“他被挂在木头上，亲身担当了我们的罪，使我们既然在罪上死，就得以在义上活。因他受的鞭伤，你们便得了医治。”（彼得前书2:24）</p>

禁食是放弃食物或活动，将时间专注于祷告。</p>
<p>Many Christians observe Good Friday as a day of fasting and prayer to focus on the suffering and sacrifice of the Lord but also as a day to refocus attention on the Father.<br>
很多基督徒将受难日作为禁食祷告的日子，专注于主的受苦与牺牲，也重新聚焦于天父。</p>
<p>Fasting and prayer remove distractions and open an opportunity to hear the heart of the Father.<br>
禁食和祷告帮助我们除去干扰，更能聆听父神的心意。</p>
<p>Fasting on Good Friday is a helpful way to unite one’s focus to Christ.<br>
在受难日禁食有助于我们专注于基督。</p>
<h3>Church Services</h3>
<h3>教会礼拜</h3>
<p>Attending a church service is common on Good Friday.<br>
参加教会礼拜是受难日常见的做法。</p>
<p>The Easter season begins with Lent six weeks prior with an Ash Wednesday service in many denominations and leads up to events during Easter week.<br>
复活节期在许多教派中以“圣灰星期三”开启四旬期，直至复活周的一系列活动。</p>
<p>Maundy Thursday commemorates the Last Supper, Good Friday the sacrifice and suffering of Christ, and Easter Sunday celebrates the fulfilled promise of Christ raising just as He promised.<br>
圣周星期四纪念最后的晚餐，受难日纪念基督的牺牲与苦难，复活节主日则庆祝基督应许的复活成就。</p>
<p>Many denominations have weekly services, including Good Friday, to ponder such a somber day.<br>
很多教会包括受难日在内，每周都有礼拜，默想如此肃穆的日子。</p>
<h3>Solemn Hymns</h3>
<h3>庄严的圣诗</h3>
<p>The singing of hymns or songs to the Lord is a way to worship Him through song.<br>
唱诗歌颂主是敬拜的一种方式。</p>
<p>Some churches make specific observations between 12 noon and 3 pm, or the hours in which Christ was on the cross to worship the Lord in song.<br>
有些教会会在正午到下午三点间（基督在十字架上的时间）特别敬拜赞美主。</p>
<p>You can sing with the people you live with or even get on a video call with your small group or family and sing together.<br>
你可以和家人、小组成员一起唱诗，或通过视频连线同唱。</p>
<h3>Burial Shroud</h3>
<h3>安放圣裹尸布</h3>
<p>This Good Friday practice is more common among the Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches.<br>
这种受难日传统在东正教和拜占庭天主教会中更为常见。</p>
<p>According to OrthoChristian.com,<br>
据OrthoChristian.com网站介绍，</p>
<p>"The Holy Shroud is taken out of the altar on Friday afternoon during the Vespers of Great Saturday, at the third hour of Holy Friday—that is, the hour of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross (the service usually begins at about two o’clock in the afternoon).<br>
“在受难日（圣星期五）下午，圣裹尸布会从祭坛中取出，在圣周六晚祷时进行，正好是耶稣在十字架上死亡的时辰（仪式一般在下午两点左右开始）。”</p>
<p>The Holy Shroud is carried out of the altar and placed into the tomb in the middle of the church. This is a raised platform adorned with flowers and perfumed as a symbol of our sorrow at the death of Christ.<br>
圣裹尸布被抬出祭坛，安放在教堂中央的“坟墓”——一个用花装饰、喷香的高台，象征我们为基督之死的哀悼。</p>
<p>The Gospel is laid in the center of the Shroud. As the Shroud is carried out, the hymn “Noble Joseph" is sung:"<br>
福音书放在裹尸布中央，抬出裹尸布时会唱“尊贵的约瑟”圣歌：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The noble Joseph,<br>
when he had taken down Thy most pure body from the Tree,<br>
wrapped it in fine linen and anointed it with spices,<br>
and placed it in a new tomb."<br>
“尊贵的约瑟，将你至圣的身体从十字架取下，以细麻布裹好，又用香膏涂抹，安放在新坟墓里。”</p>
