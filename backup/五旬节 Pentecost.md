Pentecost 五旬节

> **读经**：出埃及记 19:1-20:23；民数记 28:26-31；申命记 14:22-16:17；以西结书 1:1-28，3:12；哈巴谷书 3:1-19；路得记；马太福音 3:13-17；使徒行传 2  
> **Scripture Readings**: Exodus 19:1-20:23; Numbers 28:26-31; Deuteronomy 14:22-16:17; Ezekiel 1:1-28, 3:12; Habakkuk 3:1-19; Ruth; Matthew 3:13-17; Acts 2

五旬节是圣经七大节期之一。  
Pentecost is one of the seven biblical feasts.

五旬节在希伯来文圣经中称为 Shavuot，也称为收割节，中文也叫七七节。  
Pentecost is called *Shavuot* in the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Feast of Harvest, and in Chinese, it is called the Feast of Weeks.

Shavuot 的希伯来文字根是 sheva，中文的意思是数字 7。  
The Hebrew root of *Shavuot* is *sheva*, which means the number 7.

一个星期有 7 天，希伯来文 Shavuot 的英文是 week，中文意思是“星期”（单数）。  
A week has 7 days; the Hebrew *Shavuot* translates to "week" in English, meaning “week” (singular) in Chinese.

五旬节的英文翻译为 The Feast of Weeks，中文直接翻译为“七七节”，也就是七个星期之后的那一天，就是四十九加一为五十。  
The English translation of Pentecost is *The Feast of Weeks*, directly translated in Chinese as “Feast of Weeks,” which is the day after seven weeks, forty-nine plus one, making fifty.

五旬节还有一个希伯来文叫 Chag Hakatzir，英文翻译为 The Feast of the Harvest，中文直接翻译为“收割节”。  
Pentecost also has a Hebrew name, *Chag Hakatzir*, translated in English as *The Feast of the Harvest*, and in Chinese as “Feast of Harvest.”

五旬节还有一个希伯来文叫 Yom Habikkurim，英文翻译为 The Day of First Fruits，中文翻译为“初熟之日”，这里不是初熟的果子，初熟的果子是另外一个节期，这里指的是五旬节。  
Pentecost also has a Hebrew name, *Yom Habikkurim*, translated in English as *The Day of First Fruits*, and in Chinese as “Day of First Fruits.” This does not refer to the Feast of Firstfruits, which is a separate feast, but to Pentecost itself.

## 二、五旬节的日子
**II. The Day of Pentecost**

在收割初熟果子的时候要守七七节；又在年底要守收藏节。  
> **申命记 16:9-10** (CUV)：你要计算七七日：从你开镰收割禾稼时算起，共计七七日。你要照耶和华你神所赐的福分，向耶和华你的神献上甘心祭，守七七节。  
> **Deuteronomy 16:9-10** (ESV): You shall count seven weeks. Begin to count the seven weeks from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain. Then you shall keep the Feast of Weeks to the Lord your God with the tribute of a freewill offering from your hand, which you shall give as the Lord your God blesses you.

You shall keep the Feast of Weeks at the time of harvesting the first fruits; and at the end of the year, you shall keep the Feast of Ingathering.

## 二、五旬节当作的事情
**II. Things to Do on Pentecost**

第一，当去耶路撒冷朝见神。神要求以色列人每年在三个节期——逾越节、五旬节、住棚节——都要去耶路撒冷。  
First, go to Jerusalem to appear before God. God required the Israelites to appear in Jerusalem for three feasts each year: Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles.

> **申命记 16:16** (CUV)：你一切的男丁要在除酵节、七七节、住棚节，一年三次，在耶和华你神所选择的地方朝见他，却不可空手朝见。  
> **Deuteronomy 16:16** (ESV): Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord your God at the place that he will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Booths. They shall not appear before the Lord empty-handed.

第二，当在神面前以三个节期对应三个农业丰收的季节，逾越节是大麦丰收的季节，五旬节是小麦丰收的季节，住棚节是橄榄、葡萄丰收的季节。神要以色列人把他们田地的出产的一部分作为祭物带去耶路撒冷献给神，表达对神的感恩，在那里与亲友同吃，欢喜快乐。  
Second, during the three feasts corresponding to the three agricultural harvest seasons—Passover for the barley harvest, Pentecost for the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Tabernacles for the olive and grape harvest—God required the Israelites to bring a portion of their produce as an offering to Jerusalem to give to God, expressing gratitude, and to eat there with family and friends, rejoicing.

第三，五旬节是安息日，不可做工。  
Third, Pentecost is a Sabbath day, and no work is to be done.

> **民数记 28:26** (CUV)：在初熟节，你们献新素祭给耶和华的日子，当有圣会；什么劳碌的工都不可做。  
> **Numbers 28:26** (ESV): On the day of the firstfruits, when you offer a grain offering of new grain to the Lord at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall not do any ordinary work.

第四，五旬节要读律法，以色列人在五旬节通常读律法书（妥拉），庆祝神赐下律法给以色列。  
Fourth, on Pentecost, the Torah is read. The Israelites typically read the Torah to celebrate God giving the Law to Israel.

## 三、五旬节和律法
**III. Pentecost and the Law**

五旬节和律法的关系要追溯到出埃及记 19 章，以色列人来到西奈山。  
The relationship between Pentecost and the Law traces back to Exodus 19, when the Israelites arrived at Mount Sinai.

> **出埃及记 19:1** (CUV)：以色列人出埃及地以后，满了三个月的那一天，就来到西奈的旷野。  
> **Exodus 19:1** (ESV): On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.

以色列人一月十五日的晚上离开埃及，然后历经了一个多月的时间来到西奈山，在出埃及记 19 章第一节说，“以色列人出埃及地以后，满了三个月的那一天，就来到西奈的旷野。”这里“满了三个月”，原文的意思是第三个月的第一天。所以是在圣历第三月第一日，以色列人来到西奈山。  
The Israelites left Egypt on the evening of the fifteenth day of the first month, and after more than a month, they arrived at Mount Sinai. As stated in Exodus 19:1, “On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.” Here, “third new moon” means the first day of the third month. Thus, on the first day of the third month of the sacred calendar, the Israelites arrived at Mount Sinai.

仔细研读出埃及记 19 章、20 章、21 章的经文，我们可以得出神向以色列人显现的时候是在圣历三月六日，正好是五旬节。  
By carefully studying Exodus 19, 20, and 21, we can conclude that God appeared to the Israelites on the sixth day of the third month of the sacred calendar, which is exactly Pentecost.

这日，神在西奈山向以色列人显现，亲口将十诫说给以色列人听，颁布律法写在石版上，给以色列人，并与以色列人立约。这个约就叫西奈之约，也叫摩西之约。  
On this day, God appeared to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, personally spoke the Ten Commandments to them, issued the Law written on stone tablets, and made a covenant with them. This covenant is called the Sinai Covenant, also known as the Mosaic Covenant.

> **出埃及记 20:1-2** (CUV)：神吩咐这一切的话说：“我是耶和华你的神，曾将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来。”  
> **Exodus 20:1-2** (ESV): And God spoke all these words, saying, “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.”

## 四、五旬节和圣灵
**IV. Pentecost and the Holy Spirit**

> **使徒行传 2:1-4** (CUV)：五旬节到了，门徒都聚集在一处。忽然，从天上有响声下来，好像一阵大风吹过，充满了他们所坐的屋子，又有舌头如火焰显现出来，分别落在各人头上。他们就都被圣灵充满，按着圣灵所赐的口才说起别国的话来。  
> **Acts 2:1-4** (ESV): When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.

这个是耶稣基督在逾越节被钉十字架，受死，埋葬，在初熟的果子也就是圣历一月十六日复活之后的五旬节。  
This was the Pentecost after Jesus Christ was crucified, died, and was buried at Passover, and resurrected on the Feast of Firstfruits, which is the sixteenth day of the first month of the sacred calendar.

五旬节的时候，各地的以色列人都到耶路撒冷过节，耶稣基督的门徒聚集在一处。这个时候，圣灵降下来，充满门徒，他们开始说各地的方言，讲说神的大作为，见证耶稣是基督。  
On the day of Pentecost, Israelites from various places came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast, and the disciples of Jesus Christ were gathered together. At this time, the Holy Spirit descended, filled the disciples, and they began to speak in various languages, proclaiming the mighty works of God and testifying that Jesus is the Christ.

这是一个非常重要的日期，因为耶稣曾经预言他复活之后，圣灵要来作保惠师。  
This is a very important date because Jesus had prophesied that after His resurrection, the Holy Spirit would come as the Helper.

> **约翰福音 16:7** (CUV)：然而，我将真情告诉你们，我去是与你们有益的；我若不去，保惠师就不到你们这里来；我若去，就差他来。  
> **John 16:7** (ESV): Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.

## 五、路得与五旬节
**V. Ruth and Pentecost**

在以色列人的眼中，路得是一个外邦人，波阿斯是以色列人。路得因着信靠波阿斯，成为波阿斯的妻子，也成为神的儿女。  
In the eyes of the Israelites, Ruth was a foreigner, and Boaz was an Israelite. Through her trust in Boaz, Ruth became his wife and a child of God.

在以色列人看来，路得代表以色列，神代表波阿斯。波阿斯在五旬节娶了路得，就如神在五旬节在西奈山与以色列立约。  
In the view of the Israelites, Ruth represents Israel, and God represents Boaz. Boaz married Ruth on Pentecost, just as God made a covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai on Pentecost.

当然，外邦信徒也可以把自己看作路得，耶稣基督看作波阿斯。外邦人因着耶稣基督投靠以色列神的翅膀下，得到救赎。  
Of course, Gentile believers can also see themselves as Ruth and Jesus Christ as Boaz. Gentiles, through Jesus Christ, come under the wings of the God of Israel and receive redemption.

> **路得记 2:12** (CUV)：愿耶和华照你所行的赏赐你。你来投靠耶和华以色列神的翅膀下，愿你满得他的赏赐。  
> **Ruth 2:12** (ESV): The Lord repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!

## 总结
**Summary**

在旧约中的五旬节，神在西奈山显现，将律法写在石版上，与以色列立摩西之约。  
In the Old Testament, on Pentecost, God appeared at Mount Sinai, wrote the Law on stone tablets, and made the Mosaic Covenant with Israel.

在新约中的五旬节，圣灵在耶路撒冷降临，将律法写在人的心里，圣灵成为新约的记号。  
In the New Testament, on Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended in Jerusalem, writing the Law on people’s hearts, and the Holy Spirit became the sign of the New Covenant.

> **耶利米书 31:33** (CUV)：耶和华说：“那些日子以后，我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样：我要将我的律法放在他们里面，写在他们心上。我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。”  
> **Jeremiah 31:33** (ESV): For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
